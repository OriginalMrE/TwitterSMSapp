This is an attempt at using github in order to keep version control for an app I intend to 
try to make.

The app in question will (hopefully) notify users via SMS anytime an account they've selected 
tweets a new post, as well as anytime it retweets anything. In the future I would like to add 
a function where the app only notifies users when the accounts post about certain user input 
keywords.
